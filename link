I am from one of the smallest village of Pakistan, it is kind of most backward area. I am 6th Semester student, hardly able to reach at University level and doing my BS in Computer Science. There is no source of earning for me, My parents are hardly paying my university fees, meanwhile our means of earning are lessened due to corona, so paying this along with the university fee is kind of impossible for me. Only a degree of university is not enough for starting a career and land on a job here in Pakistan. And to get a job and start earning i have to start a new career which can be started from learning here as it is very worthy, i heard from a friend that you can apply here for financial aid which can help you. So please approve my application so i can start a new journey.




I have some prior knowledge of Python and Django for the web development, now i have decided to expand my knowledge by switching in to the most emerging field around the world. In Pakistan's IT field, there are not enough Data Scientists, which means the competition in this job would be low and its pay will be more than others. Moreover , I want to become a Data Scientist. One of my friends recommended me that learning on Coursera is much worthy and this course as the best and the most appropriate source for me to start moving in this field. Most probably, I will gain enough knowledge and understanding to land on Data Science, hopefully i will be able to continue in Data Science Field toward my target of becoming a Data Scientist and get a worthy job which would help me a lot.
